            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>The Norrington and Tompkins Tables rank Oxford and Cambridge colleges, respectively, based on their students&rsquo; 
              academic performance. But we want to turn the tables because colleges can&rsquo;t turn back the clock. 
              We&rsquo;re students ranking our colleges on the climate commitments that they should have made years ago. 
              Currently, their climate change mitigation efforts have been negligible while, in total, 
              they have over &#163;14bn in assets and an annual income of &#163;848m. Given the scale of climate emergency we face, 
              we cannot afford the sorts of half-measures we have seen from our Colleges for far too long. 
              We need real action, and we need it now. This is not a test any of us can afford to fail. </p>
            <p>How do we drive change, and fast, across these centuries-old institutions? 
              We think a healthy dose of competition will help to focus minds and accelerate radical policy changes 
              within the colleges. Colleges are ranked based on a score out of 100. They&rsquo;re scored based on a rigorous, 
              best-practice questionnaire that uses four criteria: decarbonisation plans, divestment commitments, 
              delinking from fossil fuel interests and public disclosures of all of the above.</p>
            <p>It&rsquo;s never been more clear that it is &ldquo;Code Red for Humanity&rdquo;. World leaders met at the 
              COP 26 Glasgow climate talks in November to determine global climate policy, 
              exposing even more acutely how far behind so many Colleges still are. 
              Prevarication and procrastination need to be replaced by deed and decision. 
              Colleges need to lead and champion the changes demanded by the climate crisis.</p>
